The mandlebrot set: 
The Mandelbrot set is a famous two-dimensional fractal defined on the complex plane by the equation \(z_{n+1}=z_{n}^{2}+c\) for a complex number \(c\). It comprises all complex numbers c for which the sequence of iterated values \(z_{0}=0,z_{1}=c,z_{2}=c^{2}+c,\dots \) remains bounded, meaning it does not go to infinity. Visualizations of the set use colors to show how quickly the sequence diverges for points c outside the set, creating its intricate, self-similar pattern

This program here uses the matplotlib animation package and the math from mandelbrot set to produce a short second gif of the formation of the set. More work needed to be done.
